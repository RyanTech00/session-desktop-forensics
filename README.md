## 📋 Overview

This repository documents a **forensic behavioral analysis** of [Session Desktop](https://getsession.org/), a privacy-focused messaging application that claims to offer end-to-end encryption and metadata protection.

The research was conducted as part of a **Digital Forensics** course at a Cybersecurity program (CTeSP) and reveals several **privacy vulnerabilities** that may be of interest to:

- 🔍 Digital forensics investigators
- 🔐 Security researchers
- 👤 Privacy-conscious users
- 🎓 Academic community

## ⚠️ Key Findings

### 1. Encryption Key Stored in Plain Text
The SQLCipher database encryption key is stored **in plain text** in the `config.json` file, allowing anyone with file system access to decrypt the entire database.

```
%AppData%\Roaming\Session\config.json
```

### 2. Messages Stored in Plain Text (After Decryption)
Once decrypted, all message content is stored in **clear text** in the `body` field of the `messages` table, with no additional encryption layer.

### 3. Deleted Messages Persist in Full-Text Search Index
When messages are deleted locally, the content **remains recoverable** in the `messages_fts` (Full-Text Search) table, even after physical deletion from the main table.

```sql
-- Recover deleted message content
SELECT rowid, body FROM messages_fts;
```

### 4. Remote Deletion Doesn't Actually Delete
When a sender uses "Clear for everyone", the message on the recipient's device is **NOT deleted**. Instead:
- The record is **updated** (not deleted)
- The `body` field is replaced with "This message was deleted"
- **Attachment files remain on disk**

### 5. Attachments Persist After Message Deletion
Files in the `attachments.noindex` folder are **not removed** when associated messages are deleted, remaining recoverable with the encryption key stored in the `items` table.

## 📊 Vulnerability Summary

| Vulnerability | Impact | Forensic Value |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| Plain text encryption key | Critical | Full database access |
| Clear text message storage | High | Direct content recovery |
| FTS index persistence | High | Deleted message recovery |
| Remote deletion failure | High | Content recovery on recipient device |
| Attachment persistence | Medium | Media file recovery |

## 🔬 Methodology

The analysis followed a systematic approach with **9 test scenarios**:

| ID | Scenario | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| C0 | Initial State | Baseline documentation |
| C1 | Conversation Creation | New conversation + message request |
| C2 | Message Reception | Incoming message analysis |
| C3a | Local Deletion (for me) | "Clear for me" behavior |
| C3b | Local Deletion (for everyone) | "Clear for everyone" behavior |
| C4 | Attachment Sending | Image upload analysis |
| C5 | Attachment Reception | Image + PDF download |
| C6a | Audio Reception | Voice message handling |
| C6b | Remote Deletion | Sender deletes "for everyone" |

## 🗂️ Database Structure

Session Desktop uses a **SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite** database with:

- **19 tables**
- **25 indexes**
- **3 triggers** (for FTS synchronization)

### Key Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `messages` | All sent/received messages |
| `conversations` | Contacts and conversation metadata |
| `messages_fts` | Full-text search index |
| `seenMessages` | Read receipts |
| `attachment_downloads` | Attachment download state |

### Attachment Type Identification

| Type | hasAttachments | hasFileAttachments | hasVisualMediaAttachments |
|------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Image/Video | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Document | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Audio | 1 | 0 | 0 |

## 🛠️ How to Reproduce

### Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- [Session Desktop](https://getsession.org/) installed
- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) (SQLCipher version)

### Steps

1. **Close Session Desktop** completely

2. **Locate the database**:
   ```
   %AppData%\Roaming\Session\sql\db.sqlite
   ```

3. **Get the encryption key** from:
   ```
   %AppData%\Roaming\Session\config.json
   ```

4. **Open DB Browser for SQLite** (SQLCipher version)

5. **Configure decryption**:
   - Select "SQLCipher 4 defaults"
   - Change key type to "Raw key"
   - Enter key with `0x` prefix: `0x[key_from_config.json]`

6. **Run the queries** from the `/queries` folder

## ⏱️ Blockchain Timestamp

This research report has been timestamped using **OpenTimestamps**, anchoring its existence to the Bitcoin blockchain. This provides:

- **Proof of Existence**: Cryptographic proof that the document existed at a specific date
- **Immutability**: The timestamp is permanently recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain
- **Verification**: Anyone can independently verify the timestamp

### Document Hash

```
SHA256: 53b785ee2e1b9cfcfff17dee2feb4dad828665abb2fc8144dd6d72f1c52f1983
```

### Verification

1. Download the report PDF and its `.ots` file from the `docs/` folder
2. Visit [OpenTimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org/)
3. Upload both files to verify the timestamp

The `.ots` file contains the cryptographic proof linking the document's hash to a Bitcoin transaction.
